# HashBot for Discord

HashBot is a custom Discord bot designed to interact with the Pwnagotchi network auditing tool, enhancing the functionality of the DiscoHash plugin. It allows users to request and receive network hash information directly through Discord commands.

### Acknowledgments

- The `hashbot.py` code is derived from [@flamebarke's](https://github.com/flamebarke) repository and aims to augment the DiscoHash plugin's capabilities.

### Features

- **Hash Retrieval**: Users can request hashes for a specified number of access points through Discord.
- **Command Interaction**: Easy-to-use Discord commands to interact with Pwnagotchi.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside the Pwnagotchi's DiscoHash plugin.
